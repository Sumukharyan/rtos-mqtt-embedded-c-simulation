# RTOS-based MQTT Embedded C Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an RTOS-based application using Embedded C.
The system simulates sensor data, schedules multiple tasks using FreeRTOS, and communicates using the MQTT protocol.

The application is designed to:
- Run entirely on a Windows PC without any embedded hardware
- Use real RTOS APIs and MQTT logic
- Be easily portable to microcontroller platforms such as STM32 or ESP32

## Key Concepts Used
- Embedded C programming
- FreeRTOS task scheduling
- MQTT publish/subscribe model
- Modular and hardware-agnostic design

## Project Status
🚧 Initial setup completed.  
Upcoming stages will add RTOS tasks, MQTT communication, and hardware abstraction layers.

## Target Audience
- Embedded systems beginners and fresh graduates
- Developers learning RTOS and IoT fundamentals
- Anyone looking for hardware-independent embedded simulations
